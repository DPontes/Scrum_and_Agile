# Scrum and Agile Cerimonies Template

An aggregation of templates and self-reflections for (hopefully) easy use during the Scrum cerimonies.

Based on the [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) and [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

## Daily Scrum

From the Scrum Guide:

"The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work."

The main focus of this ceremony is to plan the work to be done by the team in the coming 24 hours related to the Sprint Goal(s). The focus should be in observing and planning the flow of the remaining work to be done to achieve the Sprint Goal(s) / Product increments.

Previously there was a focus on what each team member had done, was going to do, and if they had any blocking issues.

Now the focus is on what the *team* as a whole will do to achieve the proposed Sprint Goal(s).
